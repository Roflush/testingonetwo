# Overview of "Bastions of war"/patch notes 19.01.

The Bastions of war update promised to bring a rework to Marauders, small nerfs to HACs, and buffs to Wubbles, and Interdictors.

With this update we do we say goodbye to the event called "**2021 Guardian's Gala**".

Some small changes are structures got their target painter resistance removed, and the Monitor got 2 new bays called "Drug Bay" and "Charge Bay". Other then that a user interface bug was patched. The bug pervented "some" players from finalizing character customization(Oh the honor). 

## Changes to Interdictors.

[Flycatcher] and [Heretic] got 5% added to their hitpoints. Flycatcher = shield, and Heretic = armor(15% per level now it was 10%). The [Eris] got a more interresting change, and that is a 5% added to reduction in plate mass penlty(total now is 20%/per level). then 2.5% added to **rate of fire** making for a total of 7.5%/per level.

## Assault changes.
[HACs] aka [Heavy Assault Cruisers] got hit by the CCP bat to knockout and remove the **Reduction** in _Microwarpdrive signature radius penalty_, then the _Assault Damage Controls_ got a round with the bat. CCP Reducing duration it's by 25% (1/4) and nerfed "**passive**" hull resist with Tech I now giving 25% and Tech II giving the prepatch Tech I resist of 30%.

## What's a Wubble? (Stasis Webification Probe).

A wubble is something a interdictor can shoot out of it's "[Interdiction Sphere Lancher]" It got a buff to strength going from 30% to 40%, AOE increased from 10km to 15km, and warm-up Duration got a -1 sec reduced going form 3s to 2s.

It will be cool to see them used in fleets, or by small gang.

## Bastions, marauders, and more. 

[Bastions mods] got a buff with a 50% to rate of fire and a duration reduced from 60s to 30s.

All Marauders got a Lock range increased by 30% and Sensor strength when up by 9.

note: [Golem] didn't get a rework :(.

The [Paladin] battleship bonus got capacitor capacity changed to 10% reduction to turret capacitor need(Energy). I still don't think it will beable to be capstable. 

The [Vargur] got a small change that it took it's rate of fire and changed it to dmg it's still the same 7.5%/per level tho.

The [Kronos] got a interresting cap rework, that gave it more cap by rasing capacity to 8000 Gj, and reducing the recharge to 17m and 30s. I don't think I have ever had can issues with the Kronos, but a buff is always welcomed. 


## Revelation "shadow" nerf

The [Revelation] got a interresting nerf. I am calling it a nerf, It got 80k of it's PG removed, Beam PG need reducted by 10,000 Mw (so 30k Mw fully fitted), and Beams CPU need got reducted by 10 tf (so 30 fully fitted). This is basically a nerf to the armarr dread. Because with Beam fitted you only get 30K of your PG back almost 50% of your old PG is still gone.

## Closing 

I don't think this update was bad by any means, the changes to marauders might bring some cool PVP content to hisec. Marauders are called the "dreads of hisec". I can't wait for the ones to comeout! I may to do mission guides for the marauders so stay turned.
