# What is EVE expert systems?

If the [article] is to be believed it's basically a trial system for skills. Players (aka Capsuleers) are gaven a week to try out "virtual skills" to help them "discover and experience new activities". The article says "For a one-week period per Expert System, Capsuleers will be able to taste the dream of a particular profession in EVE without having to commit to the skill training required by that path of progression and waiting for it to complete."

# Who is this for?

I am going to be 100% with you I have no idea. It's focus is on new players and older players? The article isn't very clear on who the focus is. While it's a great idea in theroy the article contradicts it's self so many times.

# what is my take?

Starting off I have no idea if this CCP, or Pearl Abyss, to be honest, I don't care. It's such a dumb idea I question if CCP even knows the people who play their game(s) anymore. Who is it for? The new player, who has minimal skills in everything, so you think it's a great idea to "virtually" throw them into a battleship without any of the "support skills" needed for guns or to even fly the thing. Sounds like a good idea for new player retention. 

It's an added microtransaction, that is added on top of hypernet that was released in 2019.  If CCP cared about new player retention they would have taken autopilot out of the tutorial, or at least said not to use it. They would also make the "Boost packs" worth for new players(only). Like selling them the "magic 14" skills, or you know giving all new accounts them. 

CCP left us on a cliffhanger with "whilst not undercutting the value of skill training, Skill Points and Skill Injectors. The first of these products to become available will be focused on exploration, mining, and the core skills required to operate spaceships in EVE (commonly referred to as the ‘Magic 14’)." What does "focused on" mean? Are they going to give the ability to fly a [Rorqual] to a new player through these things? We have no idea because they didn't say.

I don't believe over 1.3milion "distinct human beings" checked out eve online. To put it simply that is over 3,500 people a day. There has been no shift in online numbers to support this claim. If the game is growing that fast where are all of the players? Yea I have no idea either. 
So, where does that leave us? Look I am going to be honest, While companies employ people who care about their games, or products. At the end of the day, it's a corporation. I just wish that these corporations would see the value in reworking existing assets to mint retention. I would love to see a mass rework of faction Ships. Most of them are the same, or worst has their none faction corner part. I would like to see simple issues fixed also, like the graphical glitch on some NPCs stations that causes them to "unrender". Maybe I am not the "targeted audience" anymore, and you the one reading this is.
