# Starting it off 

I just got back into playing EVE again. I didn't want to do PVP, because it's starting to get old. You can only kill so many hull fit ships before you get Mad Hull Syndrome. I like abyssal space since the resistance nerfs I haven't messed with them much. I used the hawk fit markee put togehter [Hawk] before the nerf and I loved it. The only issue being the cost, at 400mil a fit (ship and implants) It's a costly missclick.

To try and save on isk I tried Jackdals, and T1/T2 missile frigs nothing worked like the hawk did. So set out to make it cheaper. I replaced shield booster with a faction [2]. It works great no issues.

## Using the hawk

Most of the time you can just go to the cans, while your shooting everything. All Battle Ships, and amarr type ships need to be orbited at 10-30km so they can't shoot you. 

You will get hit by most battleships while getting into your orbit, this isn't a issue, or atleast I haven't had an issue with it. 

It's basically the same has markee dragon's fit the only big difference you rep alot less.

I haven't tested out T2 Dark filaments with that fit, but I am sure it can do it. 

## The jackdal fail 
I brought up the jackdal at the start and I want to talk about why it didn't work.

The theroy was that if it had almost the same status has the hawk it would act like the hawk. 

I tried T2 missiles after that one, and got the same out come. 
Even put the same booster on it(The booster on the hawk).

The issue is with anything bigger then a destory it gets alpha off the field. While sharing the almost the same stats has the Hawk it just can't keep up.

I died to almost everything that was bigger then a destie.

I learned the basic status need are has followed:

- CapStable
- at least 50% in shields (More in Threm/Kin)
- min 900m/s (without the dark field bounse)
Really just use the Hawk lol
